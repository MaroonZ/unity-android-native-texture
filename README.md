# unity-android-native-texture

Minimal example of how to dynamically update a texture in Unity on Android from native C++ code.

Built with Unity 2018.2.4f1 on Ubuntu Linux 18.04, tested on Android 8.0 (should also work at least down to 7.0).

Based on https://bitbucket.org/Unity-Technologies/graphicsdemos/src/364ac57cea5c197ca9b7015ba29dcc1ff94c9f61/NativeRenderingPlugin?at=default and https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/AndroidNativePlugins.html .
